# The Big tech Players GitHub List
Fast, easy, catagorized and opinionated access to Microsoft projects on GitHub

**Note: The Big Picture**

As part of our overall concepts, we are putting together a "big picture" overview of the OSS spectrum of available projects for a  Kubernetes based end-to-end Machine Learning distributed processing continuum from Ingestion to Analytics to Visualization.

- https://github.com/cognonic/awesome-AI-kubernetes covers the distributed platform for the machine learning processing elements
- https://github.com/cognonic/on-premise-kubernetes covers the often neglected on-premise Kubernetes configurations in the range between development laptop and full cloud build-out. This will also include some basic Kubernetes and Docker container bits.
- https://github.com/cognonic/The-Cognitive-and-ML-List covers the wide variety of specific machine learning type libraries including a detailed ONNX focus
- https://github.com/cognonic/The-React-List covers the mysterious common usage in the Data Science field of JavaScript for the presentation and visualization of the hard earned results of all that distributed processing power
- https://github.com/cognonic/Augmented-Reality-Hololens covers how that hard earned visualization really deserves to move fully into this millenium as real-time Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality (i.e. Mixed Reality) walk-throughs of your data to fully embrace the potential of our modern tools.
- **(this effort)** https://github.com/cognonic/The-Big-Tech-Players-GitHub-List covers many of the major companies on GitHub which can indicate the "backing" power of certain OSS projects, a concept more of interest to enterprise consumers of OSS.

Comments, any general feedback, and additional content are always welcome and easily acheived by just opening an issue.
